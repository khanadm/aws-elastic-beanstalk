### **Note:** 
1. EB CLI configuration requires AWS Credentials, Click [Understanding and getting your AWS credentials.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys)
2. Refer [EB CLI Basics.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-getting-started.html#ebcli3-basics-create)
3. The signup-webserver directory has a file named **iam_policy.json**. Copy this policy to the attached [IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) so that the instance can access Dynamo DB and SNS Services.
